        <h1>Huge List of Unicode Symbols</h1>
        <div>
            This page provides a way to browse the huge list of Unicode symbols. The number listed under each symbols is the DECIMAL value. Use DEC2HEX() and HEX2DEC() in Excel to convert between hexidecimal and decimal. This is NOT a comprehensive list of ALL Unicode characters (such as the thousands of symbols used for different languages). I've mainly included math, emoji, dingbats, and other miscellanous symbols so that I could copy/paste the entire set into Excel to see what works within Excel.
